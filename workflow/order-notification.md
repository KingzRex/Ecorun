    Problem:
        Items ordered can be from the same or multiple vendors:
        one or many items share an order instance, 

        products for services are mostly call to other, hence I can infer that all orderable items are products from stores... so the order to items relationship is covered by products....

        transactions are linked to orders and payment-requests... 

        payment requests are generated per product.
